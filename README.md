# 🚀 DataPipeViz: Create Your First Data Pipeline with a Dashboard

Welcome to **DataPipeViz**! In this project, we’ll guide you through building a data pipeline from scratch using Kedro, and visualize the output interactively with hvPlot. You’ll learn how to preprocess, transform, and analyze data while creating interactive visualizations that offer valuable insights. Let’s dive into the world of data pipelines and interactive dashboards! 🛠️📊

## 🌐 Project Overview

Data is essential to modern businesses, and turning raw data into actionable insights is critical for success. In this project, we’ll leverage **Kedro** for building reusable and modular data pipelines, and **hvPlot** for creating interactive visualizations. We’ll start by creating a bespoke data pipeline to preprocess and transform raw data, and then visualize the processed data as interactive graphs with hvPlot. By the end, you'll have a fully operational data pipeline and an interactive dashboard to display the insights.
